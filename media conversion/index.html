            The increased affluence of musicians, both professional and amateur, and the relative inflexibility of the
            large companies has brought about a
            resurgence of the individual luthier in America. John Greven is just one of a number of successful craftsmen
            who specialize in producing hand-built
            steel-string guitars, and carrying out complex custom inlay work in abalone and mother-of-pearl. <br/>
            The guitar shown here has a German spruce top with X bracing, Indian rosewood sides and back, bound ebony
            fingerboard and ebony "pyramid"-type bridge,
            and mother-of-pearl inlay to the fingerboard and headstock. The neck is fitted with an adjustable truss rod.

            Guild has succeeded in making considerable inroads on the market for quality factory built guitars over the
            last decade. The company has concentrated on
            quality of materials and worksmanship, rather than on decoration and ornament, and thereby produced
            instruments which provide good value for money. There
            have recently, however, been signs of a slight sloppiness of finish that should not be present on largely
            hand-made guitars. <br/>
            Guild's present range includes both stand-

            -ard Dreadnoughts and more waisted folk guitars. The G-75, which was originally designed for Paul Simon, is
            unusual in having a three-quarter-size
            Dreadnought-shaped body. It has a spruce top with straightforward X bracing, rosewood sides and back,
            mahogany neck, and ebony fingerboard and bridge,
            and is fitted with Schaller tuning machines. The shape to the headstock (common to all Guild acoustic
            electrics) is reminiscent of that applied to many
            f-hole guitars in the 1930s, and although in itself attractive, looks somewhat out of place on a flat-top.
            <br/>
            The three-quarter-size Dreadnought body has many advantages besides being easier to hold than the full-size
            version. While retaining the fashionable
            square-shouldered shape, it has a warmer, easier, less aggressive and more balanced sound than the
            equivalent full Dreadnought.
